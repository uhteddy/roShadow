# roShadow
Roblox currently does not support native shadows to UI's leaving a major factor to designing UI's out. roShadow is here to help fill this gap and create a single intuitive program that will generate a drop shadow to your exact specifications and upload it directly to Roblox.

### How it will work
Once you've installed the program on your computer you will be able to configure and view your generated drop shadow including UIs with roundec corners. In v0.1.0 (alpha) you will need to manually upload the image to Roblox. However, once OpenCloud becomes expanded more you will be able to login directly with your roblox account and have roShadow upload your generated shadow image directly to Roblox.

Once completed you can generate a code-snippet for the UI in Native Lua, Roact, or Fusion. Then, in v1.0.0 (beta) you will be able to connect with a roblox plugin directly and have the shadow auto-import.
 
### Development
This plugin is currently in development and there is not currently a released version.
